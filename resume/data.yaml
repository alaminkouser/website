      As a Chrome Extension Developer at Petapator, I was instrumental in
      conceiving and creating a powerful Chrome extension tailored for patent
      enthusiasts and professionals. The extension seamlessly facilitated the
      bulk download of patents from various reputable sources, including Google
      Patents, WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization), USPTO (United
      States Patent and Trademark Office), and Espacenet. This innovative tool
      significantly streamlined patent research processes, providing users with
      efficient access to patent data for various purposes, including analysis,
      innovation, and legal requirements.
